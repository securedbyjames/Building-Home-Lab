<h1>Building Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The purpose of my home lab is to develop and strengthen both defensive and offensive cybersecurity skills by maintaining a fully isolated network environment. Within this lab, I simulate real-world attack scenarios by targeting a Windows 11 endpoint from a Kali Linux attacker machine, while enforcing access control policies, analyzing traffic, and monitoring security events through a pfSense firewall. This environment allows me to practice intrusion detection, firewall rule creation, log analysis, and incident response without exposing my host system or external networks.

<h2>My Hardware</h2>
